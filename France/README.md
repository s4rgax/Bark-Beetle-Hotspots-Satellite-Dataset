A collection of Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 images for bark beetle outbreak detection in October 2018. Images concern 92 non-overlapping scenes in the Northeast of France: 87 scenes were labeled in October 2018, 1 scene was labeled in Septemebr 2019,  1 scene was labeled in February 2020, 1 scene was labeled in March 2020 and 2 images were labeled in May 2020. The ground truth maps of the outbreaks polygons were created by SERTIT and made available in the project SWIFTT by WildSense. 

Satellite images were monthly downloaded through  both the  Microsoft Planetary platform and  the Google Earth Engine between May 2018 and October 2018 using the EPSG:3857 projection for 87 scenes labeled in October and in the month when the ground truth was acquired in the remaining scenes. Sentinel-2 images are spanned across 12 bands (B1,B2,B3,B4,B5,B6,B7,B8,B8A,B9,B11,B12) and SCL, Sentinel-1 images are spanned across two bands (VV and VH).
